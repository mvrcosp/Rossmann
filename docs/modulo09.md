## Evaluating Regression Models

The performance of a regression model must be reported as an error in those predictions.

Here we'll be talking about three metrics to evaluate regression models:

* Mean Squared Error ( MSE );
* Root mean Squared Error ( RMSE );
* Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ).

There are many other metrics for regression, although these are the most commonly used. You can see the full list of regression metrics supported by the scikit-learn library here:
