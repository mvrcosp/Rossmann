### Módulo 07 - Machine Learning Modelling

#### What is ML? 

Aprender o comportamento de vendas com as variáveis disponíveis e então generalizá-lo para o futuro.


#### Os tipos de tarefas dos Algoritmos

##### A Tarefa Supervisionada

Supervised learning (SL) is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. 

A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.

**Classification** / **Regression** / **Time Series**

##### A Tarefa Não-Supervisionada

Unsupervised learning refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify patterns in data sets containing data points that are neither classified nor labeled. 

In other words, unsupervised learning allows the system to identify patterns within data sets on its own.

Only Inputs, no target variable.

**Clustering** / **Association** 

##### A tarefa Semi-Supervisionada (Reinforcement learning)

Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.
